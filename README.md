# I spent a few weeks hitting my head to do the unit tests in C, and I couldn't do it due to several errors. I corrected several, but the last one prevented me from proceeding through time. Today, I changed the programming language to Java, managing to do the unit tests, and putting the tests to run successfully, but not being able to properly make the script. I did some tests on my machine and it didn't work to my satisfaction. I will be sending the script in the repository for your viewing.
